# Crackme's
 
We will be attempting to review/test and provide weekly crackme's. 
These are all public and will be completed before posting.  There will be full writeups within a few days of the post.
 
**1. Week 1** - This is all assembly with a few c functions mixed in.  I would recommend using a debugger if you get stuck, set breakpoints on interesting functions or operators and watch the registers.
 
**2. Week 2** - Decided to do this one with Ghidra, which makes sense seeing the pure assembly in a C sudo fashion.  Should be easier than the last but fire up a debugger if needed.
 
**3. Week 3** - This one could be easier or harder as it's a linux ELF that is pure assembly.  There is a bit of tricky math that slowed me down in the middle.  Worst case, it would be easy to brute force and then work backwards to understand (like I did).

**4. Week 4** - Pure Python fun for something different, in case people were tired of C style code.

**5. Week 5** - Thought this would be fun for a change of pace.  Just doing a simple encoding reversal using python and the crackme even posted a link to how it was encoded.  I had fun doing it and even submitted a solution.  

**6. Week 6** - Going back to an easier challenge since some of these are getting complex.  ELF written in C that should be quick.  Also, for more fun write a keygen (included).

**7. Week 7** - Medium difficulty.  Some Ghidra but mostly done with x32dbg.  Really fun to walk through each step with the debugger.

**8. Week 8** - Easy difficulty.  Quick one for this week, can do with Ghidra only.  Bonus fun for solving with Python instead of by hand.
